# Scikit-Examples
Most of models in scikit learn library would be added 
showing their functionality using a dataset.
Its accuracy would be shown by using Mean Absolute Error or suitable type.

## Note:
- Feel Free To Contribute
- Most examples here are plain Execution on dataset.
- Their performance can be improved by using many features like 
- Increasing the no of training data , Bias variance Tradeoff , Tweaking parameters 
  Feature  Normalisation , Feature Scaling etc.
- **Issues & PR are highly welcomed**
